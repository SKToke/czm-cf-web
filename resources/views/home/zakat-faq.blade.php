                                    The founders of the CZM have been trying to comprehensively comply with the tenets of Islamic code in Zakat management. As the Zakatable assets are once paid, there remain no authority of the Zakat payers on the paid assets, money or in any form. So the founders of the institutions can’t accomplish any business pursuit from the initiative as well as the CZM can no way serve any business purpose of any zakat payer. So in a nutshell the response to the question is that the founders of the CZM have no business purpose in supporting, managing or collecting Zakat and its disbursement following the codes of Islam.

                                    Individual Zakat payment may or may not achieve permanent goal of alleviating poverty and ensuring sustainable community development. Institutionalized Zakat management ensures the goal with a very structured form. As the basics of Islam encouraged plan of activities to achieve the satisfaction of Allah, the institutionalized form of Zakat management ensures gradual development of achieving the targets for serving the humanity. The previous records of Zakat management of the CZM reflects the reality.

                                    A single effort can make change. But if a lot of single efforts meet together to achieve higher objective and goal, the entire effort create the synergy. Which is a burden for a single hand a bunch of hands make the burden into an easy task. Combined efforts with concerted dedication towards achieving the basic objectives of Zakat always bring better result than expected.

                                    A single case story could be enough to define the case. From an individual’s Zakat fund, an orphan could get shelter or get some for the time being. But if the concerted effort works with very structured way it will bring better benefit. For an example in upgrading life standard of the orphans, in the structured form, Zakat funds could be collected and amassed, a pilot project could be undertaken to accomplish 50 orphans, let them access to vocational and technical training and later placement in different institutions. The process will ensure more sustainability rather than spending some money for daily meal of an orphan. So individual effort will be beneficial for the time being but concerted efforts of Zakat management will eventually ensure equitable sharing of wealth and promise a society free of poverty.

As per the tenets of Zakat management with complete guidance of Islam the disabled people are of high priority to get the services from the Zakat funds. On the other hand, the CZM believes in the dignity of the women as directed in the Holy Quran that women are the covers of the men and men are the covers of women. As Islam has always uphold the excellence of dignity of the human kind, so there is no scope of gender discrimination in conducting zakat funds for accomplishing activities and projects of the CZM.

                                    It needs a long discussion to focus on the issue. There is no doubt that paying Zakat to such institutions are worthy and ways of achieving satisfaction of the Almighty. Indeed every single good work is beneficial and an way of serving the directives of the divine guidance of Islam.

                                    The Center for Zakat Management never discourage to pay Zakat funds, assets and money to Mosque, Madrahsaah or of other institutions. The CZM always encourages any time of pro humanitarian works those correspond with the message and objectives of Zakat.

                                    As every single task depend on the intention as per the quotes of the Prophet Muhammd (PBUH), so the determination of zakat payment to the CZM for management or payment to the mentioned institutions entirely depends on the zakat payer.

                                <p class="text-black">
                                    In this concern the CZM finds its activities more structured and institutionalized and accomplish the activities in compliance with Shariah as like an individual zakat payer conduct the management in compliance with the guidance of Islam. Here the CZM is a concerted effort, work as a whole to achieve community development as directed by Islam. So eventually the results of CZM are singular, focus oriented, much stronger and obviously all the activities of the CZM are the submission to the Almighty.

                                    No, as long as you have one house, whether you have paid it off or not. If you have a second house for investment purposes, this is Zakatable. You would pay 2.5 percent on the total saved from the house. This excludes what is spent on maintenance or property taxes and insurance.
                                    It’s the same thing for a car. If you are renting a car to someone, this is considered a business entity, therefore, it is also Zakatable at 2.5 percent.
