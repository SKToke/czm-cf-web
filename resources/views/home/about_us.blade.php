                            has only been the result of many years of careful preparation; work and unbending
                            determination by a group of generous people, with a firm believe that Zakat as an important
                            tool for changing the lives of the poor and the needy of our society.</p>

                    <p class="text-dark">CZM began taking shape on the 21st of March 1993. On this date, 17 years from today, an
                        initiative, in the name of Zakat Forum (ZF), was privately launched mainly with the active
                        support of RAHIMAFROOZ BANGLADESH LTD, one of the leading conglomerates in Bangladesh. Zakat
                        Funds were privately collected and disbursed by ZF in an organized manner, guided by the
                        principles, stated in the Holy Quran.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-dark">This group of people decided to act on their faith and demonstrate an example of meaningful
                        donations of Zakat, compared to other palliative approaches demonstrated by everyone else.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-dark">After 12 years of gathering experience, in 2005, Zakat Forum took up another initiative in
                        managing Zakat fund. Targeting 150 impoverished families, residing in Manikgonj, ZF took up a
                        project, named IDEAL Village project. The underlying idea of this project was to completely
                        change the lives of 150 households, with Zakat, in all aspects such as education and economy so
                        that they may come out of the vicious cycle of poverty. This project received incredible
                        appreciations and bringing about outstanding results in fighting poverty. This was an important
                        stepping stone in the journey of Center for Zakat Management.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-dark">As more and more people began to get involved with Zakat forum, this initiative began to expand
                        its operations. In 2008, ZF decided to formalize its activities, to become a much more effective
                        initiative in the field of poverty and Zakat. In this pursuit, ZF began to discuss the prospects
                        of this initiative, with consultants from Malaysia, who were experts in Zakat Management.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-dark">The poverty scenario compelled ZF to take larger steps in Zakat management. A conclusion was
                        reached, that the problems besieging the people of Bangladesh had to be solved from the people
                        of Bangladesh itself and Zakat would be an important tool.</p>
